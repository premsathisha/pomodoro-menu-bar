# pomodoro-menu-bar
A simple Pomodoro timer that sits in the Mac menu bar to help you stay focused and productive.


## Requirements:
- MacOS
- Python 3.10+

## Why I'm working on this
Staying focused shouldn’t be complicated. That’s why I’m building this Pomodoro timer as a simple, distraction-free tool that just works, without accounts or subscriptions. It’s based on my own needs, something I plan to use daily. It’s also helping me gain hands-on experience with building native macOS tools in Python.
